Example calculation box

#### Step 3: Choose Where to Invest Remaining Amount

**Quick Comparison Table:**

| Option | Lock-in | Returns | Risk | Best For |
|--------|---------|---------|------|----------|
| ELSS | 3 years | 12-15% | High | Young investors |
| PPF | 15 years | 7.1% | Zero | Safe, long-term |
| Tax FD | 5 years | 6.5-7% | Zero | Quick, safe |

| NSC | 5 years | 7.7% | Zero | Post office fans |
| SCSS | 5 years | 8.2% | Zero | Senior citizens |

**My Recommendation by Age:**
- Under 35: ELSS (higher returns, shortest lock-in)
- 35-50: Mix of ELSS + PPF
- Above 50: PPF or SCSS (safety first)
